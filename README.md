# CPP Modules

The CPP Modules are a series of projects designed to introduce and reinforce key concepts of C++ programming. These projects are part of the 42 curriculum, aiming to build a solid foundation in object-oriented programming and advanced C++ features.

## Modules Overview

1. **CPP Module 00**: Introduction to C++, covering basic syntax, I/O streams, and memory management.
2. **CPP Module 01**: Focuses on understanding memory allocation, pointers, references, and the usage of classes.
3. **CPP Module 02**: Explores ad-hoc polymorphism, operators overloading, and canonical form.
4. **CPP Module 03**: In-depth study of inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.
5. **CPP Module 04**: Emphasizes the use of abstract classes and interfaces.
6. **CPP Module 05**: Advanced concepts like templates and exceptions handling.
7. **CPP Module 06**: Introduction to the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) and algorithmic approaches.
8. **CPP Module 07**: More advanced template usage and meta-programming techniques.
9. **CPP Module 08**: Focus on file I/O, serialization, and the final project.

## Requirements

- **Language**: C++
- **Compiler**: g++ or clang++

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cpp_modules.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the desired module directory:
    ```bash
    cd cpp_module_00
    ```
3. Compile the project:
    ```bash
    make
    ```
4. Run the executable:
    ```bash
    ./module_executable
    ```

## Project Structure

- `module_name/`: Each module has its own directory containing the source code, header files, and a `Makefile`.
